                  When I've spoken to my friends about how we see one another, a
                  few words that are frequent descriptors have been both
                  "resilient" and "soft-spoken". Attributes that I never really
                  considered for myself, but am certainly not opposed to. These
                  haven't always been the case, but my experience has certainly
                  helped shape who I am today, and made me a much better person.

              <p id="extendedbio">
                I found that College after High School was not the path for me -
                not yet at least. I spent 8 years active duty in the US Navy as
                an Electronics Technician where I worked on both internal and
                external means of communication: radios, SONAR, cryptographic
                equipment and a patch system that managed all external
                communications on these systems. By the time my first 4 years
                had finished I made the enlisted rank of Petty Officer Second
                Class in a highly competitive job for the Navy, where at the
                time across the entire Navy the advancement rate was around 3%
                for anyone eligible.
                <br />
                <br />
                By the end of my second 4 years, I had worked on and executed
                multi-million-dollar projects, became the ships expert on
                technical documentation, and was a highly trusted junior
                enlisted Sailor overseas in Japan. While stationed in Japan, I
                was a part of a team responsible for docking and undocking
                ships, submarines, and barges as well as managing helicopter
                flight operations.
                <br />
                <br />
                Upon finishing my time in the Navy, I returned to Portland State
                as the COVID pandemic started in the Spring of 2020. Since then
                I've taken classes that have taught me foundational programming
                knowledge but also algorithms and testing methodologies. For
                more on these please visit my
                <a id="unilink" href="skills.html">skills</a> page.
                <br />
                <br />
                During the Summer of 2022, I took 16 credits in order to
                finalize my graduation date and set my future up to be in a
                better position than what it would have been. Doing this was
                hard work and required a lot of dedication to accomplish
                outstanding grades in a matter of eight weeks for four classes -
                Calculus 3, Statistics, Introduction to Web Development, and
                Advanced Programming with Java. I finished off the term with an
                Advanced Programming with Java. I finished off the term with an
                'A' letter grade for each class.

                As of the Summer of 2023 - and due to a variety of circumstances
                - I am simply student worker as a Graduate student at Portland
                State University where I am furthering my knowledge and begin
                working towards my Masters in Computer Science starting Fall
                term, 2023 and finishing by Summer 2024. My plan is to take a
                large variety of courses that explore both Software Engineering
                and Artificial Intelligence. I currently am focused on
                self-teaching and exploring React through various supporting
                frameworks such as NextJS and React Native over my summer break.
