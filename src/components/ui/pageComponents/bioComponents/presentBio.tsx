        As of January 2024, I am continuing to work on my Masters degree in
        Computer Science. My first term in the program started in September
        2023, where I started off strong, worked hard, and am going into my
        second term with a 4.0 GPA.

        In my first term, I learned about critical planning and design patterns
        when it comes to projects of a variety of scale. I had already had some
        instructional insight on this from my Undergraduate degree, but this
        different version went into depth about understanding many facets of
        software development I had not previously been taught.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, I took a class called &#34;Internet, Web & Cloud
        Systems&#34; where I learned all about what goes into make a cloud based
        application. My final project for this class was to do just that as
        well! You can learn more about it by visiting my projects page.
