                As of January 2025, I am continuing my Master&#39;s degree in
                Computer Science at Portland State University, maintaining a
                3.94 GPA as I enter my second to final term. My journey began in
                September 2023, and I&#39;ve built on my academic foundation
                through coursework, research, and professional experiences.
                <br />
                <br />
                During my first term, I delved into critical planning and design
                patterns, expanding my understanding of software development
                across projects of varying scales. While I had some foundational
                knowledge from my undergraduate studies, this deeper exploration
                provided new perspectives on designing efficient, scalable, and
                maintainable systems.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also completed a course titled &#34;Internet, Web & Cloud
                Systems,&#34; which covered the complexities of developing
                cloud-based applications. For my final project, I designed and
                implemented a fully functional cloud application, further
                solidifying my expertise in modern web technologies and cloud
                platforms.
                <br />
                <br />
                Beyond my coursework, I authored a research paper in computer
                vision, exploring innovative techniques for solving real-world
                challenges. Additionally, my time at CDK Global provided
                invaluable hands-on experience, where I contributed to impactful
                projects, honed my technical skills, and collaborated with
                industry professionals.
