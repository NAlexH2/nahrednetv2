            Over the years, friends have described me as &quot;resilient&quot;
            and &quot;soft-spoken&quot; â€” qualities I&apos;ve grown to embrace
            as reflections of both my character and journey. These traits
            weren&apos;t always a natural part of me, but the challenges
            I&apos;ve faced and the experiences I&apos;ve gained have shaped me
            into a more grounded and thoughtful individual.
