      I found that College after High School was not the path for me - not yet
      at least. I spent 8 years active duty in the US Navy as an Electronics
      Technician where I worked on both internal and external means of
      communication: radios, SONAR, cryptographic equipment and a patch system
      that managed all external communications on these systems. By the time my
      first 4 years had finished I made the enlisted rank of Petty Officer
      Second Class in a highly competitive job for the Navy, where at the time
      across the entire Navy the advancement rate was around 3% for anyone
      eligible.
      <br />
      <br />
      By the end of my second 4 years, I had worked on and executed
      multi-million-dollar projects, became the ships expert on technical
      documentation, and was a highly trusted junior enlisted Sailor overseas in
      Japan. While stationed in Japan, I was a part of a team responsible for
      docking and undocking ships, submarines, and barges as well as managing
      helicopter flight operations.
      <br />
      <br />
      Upon finishing my time in the Navy, I returned to Portland State as the
      COVID pandemic started in the Spring of 2020. Since then I&#39;ve taken
      classes that have taught me foundational programming knowledge but also
      algorithms and testing methodologies.{" "}

      During the Summer of 2022, I took 16 credits in order to finalize my
      graduation date and set my future up to be in a better position than what
      it would have been. Doing this was hard work and required a lot of
      dedication to accomplish outstanding grades in a matter of eight weeks for
      four classes - Calculus 3, Statistics, Introduction to Web Development,
      and Advanced Programming with Java. I finished off the term with an
      Advanced Programming with Java. I finished off the term with an
      &#39;A&#39; letter grade for each class.
      <br />
      <br />
      Finally, in the spring of 2023, I received my Bachelors of Science in
      Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. After a long journey, I was
      finally at a destination I was incredibly proud of. Ever since I left for
      the Navy, I had one concrete goal in mind: to come back to Portland State
      University and receive my degree, and be proud of the work I did along the
      way. It was something I had said for what felt like every month to someone
      - if not at least once a week - while I was in the military that this was
      my absolute dream.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, due to a variety of circumstances and the state of the economy,
      during the summer of 2023 I was simply student worker as a Graduate
      student at Portland State University where I am furthering my knowledge
      and began working towards my Masters in Computer Science starting Fall
      term, September 2023. My plan is to take a large variety of courses that
      explore both Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I currently
      am focused on self-teaching and exploring React through various supporting
      frameworks such as NextJS and React Native over my summer break (which
      this site was built with!)
