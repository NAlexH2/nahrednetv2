        When I&#39;ve spoken to my friends about how we see one another, a few
        words that are frequent descriptors have been both &#34;resilient&#34;
        and &#34;soft-spoken&#34;. Attributes that I never really considered for
        myself, but am certainly not opposed to. These haven&#39;t always been
        the case, but my experience has certainly helped shape who I am today,
        and made me a much better person.
