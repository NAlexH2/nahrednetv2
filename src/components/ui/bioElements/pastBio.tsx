      I found that College after High School was not the path for me - not yet
      at least. I spent 8 years active duty in the US Navy as an Electronics
      Technician where I worked on both internal and external means of
      communication: radios, SONAR, cryptographic equipment and a patch system
      that managed all external communications on these systems. By the time my
      first 4 years had finished I made the enlisted rank of Petty Officer
      Second Class in a highly competitive job for the Navy, where at the time
      across the entire Navy the advancement rate was around 3% for anyone
      eligible.

      <br />
      By the end of my second 4 years, I had worked on and executed
      multi-million-dollar projects, became the ships expert on technical
      documentation, and was a highly trusted junior enlisted Sailor overseas in
      Japan. While stationed in Japan, I was a part of a team responsible for
      docking and undocking ships, submarines, and barges as well as managing
      helicopter flight operations.

      Upon finishing my time in the Navy, I returned to Portland State as the
      COVID pandemic started in the Spring of 2020. Since then I&#39;ve taken
      classes that have taught me foundational programming knowledge but also
      algorithms and testing methodologies. For more on these please visit my
      skills page.

      During the Summer of 2022, I took 16 credits in order to finalize my
      graduation date and set my future up to be in a better position than what
      it would have been. Doing this was hard work and required a lot of
      dedication to accomplish outstanding grades in a matter of eight weeks for
      four classes - Calculus 3, Statistics, Introduction to Web Development,
      and Advanced Programming with Java. I finished off the term with an
      Advanced Programming with Java. I finished off the term with an
      &#39;A&#39; letter grade for each class.
