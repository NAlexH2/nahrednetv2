      <p>
        As of the Summer of 2023 - and due to a variety of circumstances - I am
        simply student worker as a Graduate student at Portland State University
        where I am furthering my knowledge and begin working towards my Masters
        in Computer Science starting Fall term, 2023 and finishing by Summer
        2024. My plan is to take a large variety of courses that explore both
        Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I currently am focused
        on self-teaching and exploring React through various supporting
        frameworks such as NextJS and React Native over my summer break.{" "}
