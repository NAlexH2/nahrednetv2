https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-github-pages - credit to this person for
writing up a great explainer on how to deploy ghpages nextjs projects. Without it I wouldn't have learned! You can do some incredibly powerful stuff inside of a github action and their writeup and demo action is perfect to learn from.

The script is really cool too!
